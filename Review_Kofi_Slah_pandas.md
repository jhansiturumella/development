## Review Kofi - Slah Solution
## Organization:

Every thing has been organized well. But i could not find the information about kaggle.
Description about pandas is explained.

## Basic Info:
Everything has been displayed well.

## Cleaning:
Task accomplished

## Concatenating:
First 3 points were explained well but the below validation is missing under concatination.
-->Remove movies with more than one director and rename director_ids => director_id

## Exploration:
1) How many movie has been made in the 2000's?-- Missing the count of movies made after 2000
2) Get all the movies directed by Akira Kurosawa ordered by year DESC -- Not in descending order
