pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, that is constructed on top of Numpy.
It is in easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
We can read any types of file through panda.
 It allows do fast analysis as well as data cleaning and preparation.
We can easily handle the missing data and outliers.
 It can easily represent data in a form naturally suited for data analysis via its DataFrame and Series data structures in a concise manner.
 Doing the equivalent in Java/C/C++ would require many lines of custom code, as these languages were not built for data analysis but rather networking and kernel development.
Its concise and clear API allows the user to focus more on the core goal at hand, rather than have to write a lot of scaffolding code in order to perform routine tasks.
we can easily visualize the data through pandas inbuilt libraries.
Numerical, string operations are easily handled by the pandas.
We can easily merge or join the two DataFrames.
